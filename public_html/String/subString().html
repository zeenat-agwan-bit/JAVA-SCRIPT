<!--
the subString() method is similar to slice().
the first argument specifies the index at
which the desired substring begins.
the optional second argument indicates the index 
at which the desired substring ends.
the method returns a string containing the
substring beginning at the given index up to
but not including the character at the
index specified by the second argument.
the difference between slice and subString
is that subString()
cant accept negative indexes
